## Run Daily

There are two methods on how to run this program automatically every day.

#### First method: Via the WebUI
The option `Send the scheduled messages daily` in the navigation bar once logged onto the WebUI repeats the `Send the scheduled messages once` every day. It has a built in sleep function that sleeps for around 24 hours before executing again. **The WebUI will keep loading because the Python proces is not done until the sleep is over. Please do not open an issue saying that the page keeps loading indefinitely.**

#### Second method: Crontab (Linux) or Windows Task Scheduler (Windows)
WA-ScheduledMessenger can be added to the Crontab table (Linux) and to Windows Task Scheduler (Windows). If you use any other program that schedules and runs programs every day, you can use that.

The Python program that needs to be added to the scheduler application is ScheduledMessenger.py.
